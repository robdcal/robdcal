- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rob Callaghan. I'm based in Cheshire, UK.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building things that solve problems (and some things just for fun!). Here's some examples:
  - [NHS Dentist Finder](https://nhs-dentist-finder.netlify.app/)
  - [URL Descronstructor](https://robdcal.github.io/url-deconstructor/)
  - To Do List ([React version](https://robdcal.github.io/todo-react/) and [Full Stack PERN version](https://robdcal.github.io/todo-fullstack/))
  - [Product Configurator](https://www.bluechiptechnology.com/beta/configurator/)
  - [Freelance Rate Calculator](https://www.virtual-headquarters.com/freelance-rate-calculator/)
  - [Random Country Fact Generator](https://robdcal.github.io/random-country-fact-generator/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data structures and algorithms, as well as building [Film Night](https://github.com/robdcal/film-night-app).
